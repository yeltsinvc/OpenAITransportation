# Transportation Data Analysis Project

This project aims to analyze transportation data by determining the origin-destination matrix of trips and showcasing relevant statistics to understand mobility patterns.

## Requirements

- Python 3.7 or higher
- The pandas, matplotlib.

## Environment Setup

1. Clone the repository to your local machine: `git clone https://github.com/yeltsinvc/OpenAITransportation`
2. Navigate to the project directory: `cd OpenAITransportation/mobility_data_analysis/shared_mobility`
3. Add `Shared_Micromobility_Vehicle_Trips.csv` in data folder

## Data
Data can be download from https://data.austintexas.gov/Transportation-and-Mobility/Shared-Micromobility-Vehicle-Trips/7d8e-dm7r

## Usage

1. Run the `main.py` script to generate the origin-destination matrix and distance charts.
2. The images will be saved in the 'Results' and 'Distance' folders, respectively.

## Usage
1. Matrix OD by day
