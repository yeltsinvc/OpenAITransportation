# Traffic Simulation Project using Vissim

This project aims to simulate vehicular traffic using Vissim with the Interzis Com Python library and calibrate the model using real traffic flow data.

## Project Structure

The project consists of the following files and folders:

- `model/`: Folder containing the configuration files and simulation results generated using Vissim.

- `data/`: Folder containing the real traffic flow data used to calibrate the model.

- `scripts/`: Folder containing the Python scripts used to run simulations and calibrate the model.

- `README.md`: Documentation file describing the project and its structure.

## Requirements

The project requires the following software and libraries to be installed:

- Vissim 11 or higher.

- Python 3.x with pandas, numpy, and scipy libraries.

## Usage

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.

2. Configure the configuration files in the `model/` folder according to your simulation needs.

3. Run the `calibrate_model.py` script in the `scripts/` folder to calibrate the model using real traffic flow data in the `data/` folder.

4. Review the simulation results and model calibration in the `model/` folder.
